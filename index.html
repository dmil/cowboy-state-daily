    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>Articles were collected from Cowboy State Daily and converted to text embeddings using OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings">embeddings API endpoint</a>. The distances between embeddings were then visualized in a <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html">two-dimensional t-sne plot</a> using the scikit-learn package in Python. A two-dimenional hoverable scatter plot was then generated in D3 with the help of Open AI's ChatGPT 3.5 using the following prompt:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I have a CSV file named vis_dims.csv with the following columns: title, publish_date, website, url, authors, x and y. Show me the code to make a scatterplot in D3 with a tooltip. Each dot should be placed at x,y. When a user hovers on the tooltip, they should see the title and publish date. When they click on a dot, it should navigate to the url. And please add a search box that will let users filter by searching the title column.
      </p>
